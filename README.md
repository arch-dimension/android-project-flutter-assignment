Dry Answers:
1) The class used to implement the controller pattern is called SnappingSheetController. 
It allows the developer to control the following features:
setting the position of the snapping sheet without animation
and whether the sheet snaps to a given position or stops the snap.

2) The parameter of snapping sheet which controls the snapping behavior and its animation(if any) is 
of the SnappingPosition class within the snapToPosition method.

3) An advantage of Inkwell over GestureDetector is the ability to create 
a visible ink splash when the user taps the widget, giving the user visual feedback.
On the other hand GestureDetector can listen to accessibility events, unlike Inkwell.
